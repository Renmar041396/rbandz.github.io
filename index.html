                        I was born in Cebu city. When I was in my elementary days, I spent most of my time playing computer games and not attending some of my classes, never proud of it though. I did not perform well academically before, but I have learned many things as I spent more time using computers such as file explorer and basic CMD commands for some game engines. My family then migrated to Baguio City when I was 14, little did I know that the city will be my biggest turning point. I took my IT degree at Informatics Philippines and received various awards such as deanâ€™s list and some certificates from a competition of TESDA (Java programming). I was then a Fraud Analyst for 2 years and it was my first job, I decided to take BS Computer Science at the University of The Philippines. During my time in UP, as a breadwinner, I must work hard, unfortunately, I filed for LOA so I can focus professionally.

                        Technology is not just a tool for learning, but it is also an integral part of the learning process. Technology can be used in Academe to help students learn more efficiently and effectively. It can also be used as a tool for training in order to improve the quality of training programs.
    
                        It's important to think critically about technology and its impacts on society. We have to ask ourselves: How does technology affect people's lives? What are the implications of this new digital world?
